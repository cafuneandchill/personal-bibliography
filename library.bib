abstract = {After the devastation of genetics in our country, Academician Leon A. Orbeli has provided an opportunity for the studies on evolutionary conservatism of genes controlling the main properties of the higher nervous activity and conditioning. For the last few years, determination and bioinformatic analysis of genome sequences in the plant, worm, Drosophila, and human genome have revealed, indeed, a high interspecies homology of genes. Studies on Drosophila mutants have shown that components of intracellular signalization systems regulating neuronal functions and gene expression are organized in supramolecular complexes. It has become evident that the chromosomal architecture predetermines the appearance of deletions, duplications, insertions, and translocations and, therefore, plays an important role not only in evolution but also in generating human pathological syndromes with multiple manifestations, including cognitive dysfunctions. There appeared a new approach, comparative genomics, that allows revealing functions of human disease genes on the basis of their sequence homology to the known Drosophila gene with various well-studied mutant phenotypes. For this reason, the Drosophila genes should be saturated with mutant phenotypes, and these are to be studied in comparison with the chromosomal architecture. Our complex behavioral and molecular-genetic study of spontaneous, induced, and P-insertional mutations in the Drosophila agnostic locus and the bioinformatic analyses of genomic sequences has allowed us to assign the locus to the Drosophila genomic scaffold AE003489 from the 11AB X-chromosomal region that contains the CG1848 gene coding for LIM-kinase 1. Mutations, insertions, and deletions in the agnostic locus lead to an increased activity of Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent PDE1, resistance to ether, an inactivator of synaptic transmission, impairments of the brain structures, learning and memory defects in conditioned courtship suppression paradigm, alterations in sound production and in structural-functional chromosomal organization. Therefore, the agnostic locus represents a model to study the human Williams syndrome with multiple dysfunctions due to a contiguous deletion in the 7q11.23 spanning 17 genes, among them the gene for LIM-kinase 1 presumed to be responsible for cognitive defects. The Williams syndrome is considered to be a most efficient model to study human cognition, human genome organization, and evolution.},

abstract = {Rho GTPases are essential regulators of cytoskeletal reorganization, but how they do so during neuronal morphogenesis in vivo is poorly understood. Here we show that the actin depolymerization factor cofilin is essential for axon growth in Drosophila neurons. Cofilin function in axon growth is inhibited by LIM kinase and activated by Slingshot phosphatase. Dephosphorylating cofilin appears to be the major function of Slingshot in regulating axon growth in vivo. Genetic data provide evidence that Rho or Rac/Cdc42, via effector kinases Rok or Pak, respectively, activate LIM kinase to inhibit axon growth. Importantly, Rac also activates a Pak-independent pathway that promotes axon growth, and different RacGEFs regulate these distinct pathways. These genetic analyses reveal convergent and divergent pathways from Rho GTPases to the cytoskeleton during axon growth in vivo and suggest that different developmental outcomes could be achieved by biases in pathway selection.},

abstract = {Genomic diseases or syndromes with multiple manifestations arise spontaneously and unpredictably as a result of contiguous deletions and duplications generated by unequal recombination in chromosomal regions with a specific architecture. The Williams syndrome is believed to be one of the most attractive models for linking genes, the brain, behavior and cognitive functions. It is a neurogenetic disorder resulting from a 1.5 Mb deletion at 7q11.23 which covers more than 20 genes; the hemizigosity of these genes leads to multiple manifestations, with the behavioral ones comprising three distinct domains: 1) visuo-spatial orientation; 2) verbal and linguistic defect; and 3) hypersocialisation. The shortest observed deletion leads to hemizigosity in only two genes: eln and limk1. Therefore, the first gene is supposed to be responsible for cardiovascular pathology; and the second one, for cognitive pathology. Since cognitive pathology diminishes with a patient's age, the original idea of the crucial role of genes straightforwardly determining the brain's morphology and behavior was substituted by ideas of the brain's plasticity and the necessity of finding epigenetic factors that affect brain development and the functions manifested as behavioral changes. Recently, non-coding microRNAs (miRs) began to be considered as the main players in these epigenetic events. This review tackles the following problems: is it possible to develop relatively simple model systems to analyze the contribution of both a single gene and the consequences of its epigenetic regulation in the formation of the Williams syndrome's cognitive phenotype? Is it possible to use Drosophila as a simple model system?. {\textcopyright} 2014 Park-media, Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Courtship behavior in Drosophila has been causally linked to the activity of the heterogeneous set of ∼1500 neurons that express the sex-specific transcripts of the fruitless (fru) gene, but we currently lack an appreciation of the cellular diversity within this population, the extent to which these cells are sexually dimorphic, and how they might be organized into functional circuits. Results: We used genetic methods to define 100 distinct classes of fru neuron, which we compiled into a digital 3D atlas at cellular resolution. We determined the polarity of many of these neurons and computed their likely patterns of connectivity, thereby assembling them into a neural circuit that extends from sensory input to motor output. The cellular organization of this circuit reveals neuronal pathways in the brain that are likely to integrate multiple sensory cues from other flies and to issue descending control signals to motor circuits in the thoracic ganglia. We identified 11 anatomical dimorphisms within this circuit: neurons that are male specific, are more numerous in males than females, or have distinct arborization patterns in males and females. Conclusions: The cellular organization of the fru circuit suggests how multiple distinct sensory cues are integrated in the fly's brain to drive sex-specific courtship behavior. We propose that sensory processing and motor control are mediated through circuits that are largely similar in males and females. Sex-specific behavior may instead arise through dimorphic circuits in the brain and nerve cord that differentially couple sensory input to motor output. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The courtship song of the Drosophila male serves as a genetically tractable model for the investigation of the neural mechanisms of decision-making, action selection, and motor pattern generation. Singing has been causally linked to the activity of the set of neurons that express the sex-specific fru transcripts, but the specific neurons involved have not been identified. Here we identify five distinct classes of fru neuron that trigger or compose the song. Our data suggest that P1 and pIP10 neurons in the brain mediate the decision to sing, and to act upon this decision, while the thoracic neurons dPR1, vPR6, and vMS11 are components of a central pattern generator that times and shapes the song's pulses. These neurons are potentially connected in a functional circuit, with the descending pIP10 neuron linking the brain and thoracic song centers. Sexual dimorphisms in each of these neurons may explain why only males sing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Although they show significant structural similarity, LIMK1 and LIMK2 show different expression, subcellular localization, and functions. They are involved in many cellular func- tions, such as migration, cycle, and neuronal differentiation and also have a role in pathological processes, such as cancer cell invasion and metastatis, as well as in neurodevelopmental disorders (namely, the William's syndrome). LIM kinases have a relevant number of known partners that are able to induce or limit the ability of LIMK1 and LIMK2 to phosphorylate and inactivate their major substrate, cofilin. On the contrary, only a limited number of small molecules that interact with the two proteins to modulate their kinase activity have been identified. In this review, the most important partners of LIM kinases and their modulating activity toward LIMKs are described. The small com- pounds identified as LIMK1 and LIMK2 modulators are also reported, as well as their role as possible therapeutic agents for LIMK-induced diseases.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Chlo{\'{e}} Prunier et al. LIM kinases are common downstream effectors of several signalization pathways and function as a signaling node that controls cytoskeleton dynamics through the phosphorylation of the cofilin family proteins. These last 10 years, several reports indicate that the functions of LIM kinases are more extended than initially described and, specifically, that LIM kinases also control microtubule dynamics, independently of their regulation of actin microfilament. In this review we analyze the data supporting these conclusions and the possible mechanisms that could be involved in the control of microtubules by LIM kinases. The demonstration that LIM kinases also control microtubule dynamics has pointed to new therapeutic opportunities. Consistently, several new LIM kinase inhibitors have been recently developed. We provide a comprehensive comparison of these inhibitors, of their chemical structure, their specificity, their cellular effects as well as their effects in animal models of various diseases including cancer.},

abstract = {Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cellular processes during animal development. Cofilin and actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) are potent actin-binding proteins that sever and depolymerize actin filaments, acting to generate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. The activity of cofilin is spatially and temporally regulated by a variety of intracellular molecular mechanisms. Cofilin is regulated by cofilin binding molecules, is phosphorylated at Ser-3 (inactivation) by LIM-kinases (LIMKs) and testicular protein kinases (TESKs), and is dephosphorylated (reactivation) by slingshot protein phosphatases (SSHs). Although studies of the molecular mechanisms of cofilin-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton have been ongoing for decades, the multicellular functions of cofilin and its regulation in development are just becoming apparent. This review describes the molecular mechanisms of generating actin dynamics by cofilin and the intracellular signaling pathways for regulating cofilin activity. Furthermore, recent findings of the roles of cofilin in the development of several tissues and organs, especially neural tissues and cells, in model animals are described. Recent developmental studies have indicated that cofilin and its regulatory mechanisms are involved in cellular proliferation and migration, the establishment of cellular polarity, and the dynamic regulation of organ morphology.},

abstract = {Modification of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for synaptic plasticity, which is believed to underlie the brain's capacity for learning and memory. Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by LIM Kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) and their downstream targets Actin Depolymerization Factor/Cofilin (ADF/Cofilin) in the mouse forebrain modulates dendritic spine morphology, synaptic function, long-term potentiation (LTP), and learning and memory, but appear dispensable for the regulation of most forms of presynaptic plasticity. However, these analyses were performed in mice mutant for single members of these gene families, and thus the interpretation of these results is confounded by potential compensatory activity of homologous genes. The objective of this study is to characterize the role of the single Drosophila homolog of the LIMK family (dLIMK1) and the single neuronally-expressed Drosophila homolog of ADF/Cofilin (Twinstar; Tsr) in morphological and functional plasticity of motoneurons. Additionally, we wish to investigate the actin-based cellular mechanisms that contribute to these forms of synaptic plasticity. We found that dLIMK1 acts via Tsr to restrain synaptic growth in the presynaptic terminal, especially by restraining the formation of immature branching boutons. Functionally, we found that Tsr activity is important for the proper Ca2+-cooperativity of vesicle fusion and normal paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and that both dLIMK1 and Tsr are required for proper tetanus-induced potentiation (TIP). Furthermore, both dLIMK1 mutants and tsr mutants displayed synaptic depression. These results demonstrate that dLIMK1 and Tsr modulate developmentally-regulated morphological and activity-dependent functional plasticity of Drosophila motoneurons and illustrate the conservation of mechanisms regulating neuronal branching between postsynaptic excitatory neurons in mice and presynaptic motoneurons in Drosophila. These results suggest that the lack of alterations in presynaptic forms of plasticity in mice mutant for  LIMK1 or non-muscle cofilin (n-cof) are a consequence of compensation by LIMK2 and ADF, respectively.

In this review we discuss new aspects of previously documented regulation, such as phosphorylation, but also cover novel recently established modes of regulation and functions of ADF (also known as destrin)/cofilin. We now understand that their activity responds to a vast array of inputs far greater than previously appreciated and that these proteins not only feed back to the crucially important dynamics of actin, but also to apoptosis cascades, phospholipid metabolism, and gene expression.

abstract = {Deletion of the LIMK1 gene is associated with Williams syndrome, a unique neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe defects in visuospatial cognition and long-term memory (LTM). However, whether LIMK1 contributes to these deficits remains elusive. Here, we show that LIMK1-knockout (LIMK1 −/− ) mice are drastically impaired in LTM but not short-term memory (STM). In addition, LIMK1 −/− mice are selectively defective in late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP), a form of long-lasting synaptic plasticity specifically required for the formation of LTM. Furthermore, we show that LIMK1 interacts and regulates the activity of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), an extensively studied transcriptional factor critical for LTM. Importantly, both L-LTP and LTM deficits in LIMK1 −/− mice are rescued by increasing the activity of CREB. These results provide strong evidence that LIMK1 deletion is sufficient to lead to an LTM deficit and that this deficit is attributable to CREB hypofunction. Our study has identified a direct gene-phenotype link in mice and provides a potential strategy to restore LTM in patients with Williams syndrome through the enhancement of CREB activity in the adult brain.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that control the translation of target messenger RNAs, thereby regulating critical aspects of plant and animal development. In the mammalian nervous system, the spatiotemporal control of mRNA translation has an important role in synaptic development and plasticity. Although a number of microRNAs have been isolated from the mammalian brain, neither the specific microRNAs that regulate synapse function nor their target mRNAs have been identified. Here we show that a brain-specific microRNA, miR-134, is localized to the synapto-dendritic compartment of rat hippocampal neurons and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines--postsynaptic sites of excitatory synaptic transmission. This effect is mediated by miR-134 inhibition of the translation of an mRNA encoding a protein kinase, Limk1, that controls spine development. Exposure of neurons to extracellular stimuli such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor relieves miR-134 inhibition of Limk1 translation and in this way may contribute to synaptic development, maturation and/or plasticity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the Genetics Society of America. To facilitate large-scale functional studies in Drosophila, the Drosophila Transgenic RNAi Project (TRiP) at Harvard Medical School (HMS) was established along with several goals: developing efficient vectors for RNAi that work in all tissues, generating a genome-scale collection of RNAi stocks with input from the community, distributing the lines as they are generated through existing stock centers, validating as many lines as possible using RT–qPCR and phenotypic analyses, and developing tools and web resources for identifying RNAi lines and retrieving existing information on their quality. With these goals in mind, here we describe in detail the various tools we developed and the status of the collection, which is currently composed of 11,491 lines and covering 71{\%} of Drosophila genes. Data on the characterization of the lines either by RT–qPCR or phenotype is available on a dedicated website, the RNAi Stock Validation and Phenotypes Project (RSVP, http://www.flyrnai.org/RSVP.html), and stocks are available from three stock centers, the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (United States), National Institute of Genetics (Japan), and TsingHua Fly Center (China).},

At that time it emerged that there were a number of human diseases and disorders that involved either actin by itself, or was the result of altered assembly of the actin cytoskeleton produced by ABPs. This book is assembled into three sections. We begin with an overview of actin where we review the structure of this ubiquitous protein, the biophysics of actin polymerisation, and set the groundwork for a detailed discussion on how actin comes to play a role in human disease.},

abstract = {A search for Drosophila mutants with phenotypes similar to human diseases might help to unravel evolutionary conserved genes implicated in polygenic human disorders. Among these are neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by a late onset disturbance of memory, structural brain impairments and altered content of the intermediates of the kynurenine pathway. The ratio between kynurenate (KYNA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HOK) in the brain is a critical determinant of neuronal viability. Therefore, the Drosophila mutants cinnabar (KYNA excess) and cardinal (3-HOK excess) allow an evaluation of the specific roles of these metabolites which present in physiologic concentrations and mimic systemic administration. Previously we have demonstrated that the mutant cardinal can serve as a model for dementia and can help to unravel the earliest manifestations of brain dysfunction. Here we show that a state of the brain control of locomotor coordination characterized by the parameters of sound production in males results from the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of KYNA and 3-HOK accumulated in young and aged Drosophila mutants. The high instability of 1) cycle form and number in pulses; 2) of pulse amplitude and 3) rhythm in the courtship song of aged cardinal males are similar to the alterations in mutants with defective central complex of the brain The cardinal mutants demonstrate apoptosis in the brain after stress treatment. This might reflect the misbalance in the content of excitatory amino acids' and the glycine site agonists revealed by HPLC-determination. The mutant cinnabar proved to be normal in respect of the parameters studied.},

abstract = {The LIM kinase family consists of just two members: LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) and LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2). With uniquely organised signalling domains, LIM kinases are regulated by several upstream signalling pathways, principally acting downstream of Rho GTPases to influence the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton by regulating the activity of the cofilin family proteins cofilin1, cofilin2 and destrin. Although the LIM kinases are very homologous, particularly when comparing kinase domains, there is emerging evidence that each may be subject to different regulatory pathways and may contribute to both distinct and overlapping cellular and developmental functions. Normal central nervous system development is reliant upon the presence of LIMK1, and its deletion has been implicated in the development of the human genetic disorder Williams syndrome. Normal testis development, on the other hand, is disrupted by the deletion of LIMK2. In addition, the possible involvement of each kinase in cardiovascular disorders as well as cancer has recently emerged. The LIM kinases have been proposed to play an important role in tumour-cell invasion and metastasis; fine-tuning the balance between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated cofilin may be a significant determinant of tumour-cell metastatic potential. In this review, we outline the structure, regulation and function of LIM kinases and their functions at cellular and organismal levels, as well as their possible contributions to human disease.},

abstract = {LIM kinases (LIMK1/2) are LIM domain-containing serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases that mediate multiple cellular processes in mitosis. In the present study, we explored the functional roles and potential signaling pathway of LIMK1/2 during mouse oocyte meiosis. Disruption of LIMK1/2 activity and expression significantly decreased oocyte polar body extrusion. Live-cell imaging revealed that spindle migration was disturbed after both LIMK1 and LIMK2 knock down, and this might be due to aberrant distribution of actin filaments in the oocyte cytoplasm and cortex. Meanwhile, our results demonstrated that the function of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in actin assembly was related to cofilin phosphorylation levels. In addition, disruption of LIMK1/2 activity significantly increased the percentage of oocytes with abnormal spindle morphologies, which was confirmed by the abnormal p-MAPK localization. We further, explored the upstream molecules of LIMK1/2, and we found that after depletion of ROCK, phosphorylation of LIMK1/2 and cofilin were significantly decreased. Moreover, RhoA inhibition caused the decreased expression of ROCK, p-LIMK1/2, and cofilin. In summary, our results indicated that the small GTPase RhoA regulated LIMK1/2-cofilin to modulate cytoskeletal dynamics during mouse oocyte meiosis.},

abstract = {The neurobiology of memory formation attracts much attention in the last five decades. Conversely, the rules that govern and the mechanisms underlying forgetting are less understood. In addition to retroactive interference, retrieval-induced forgetting and passive decay of time, it has been recently demonstrated that the nervous system has a diversity of active and inherent processes involved in forgetting. In Drosophila, some operate mainly at an early stage of memory formation and involves dopamine (DA) neurons, specific postsynaptic DA receptor subtypes, Rac1 activation and induces rapid active forgetting. In mammals, others regulate forgetting and persistence of seemingly consolidated memories and implicate the activity of DA receptor subtypes and AMPA receptors in the hippocampus (HP) and related structures to activate parallel signaling pathways controlling active time-dependent forgetting. Most of them may involve plastic changes in synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors including specific removal of GluA2 AMPA receptors. Forgetting at longer timescales might also include changes in adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the HP. Therefore, based on relevance or value considerations neuronal circuits may regulate in a time-dependent manner what is formed, stored, and maintained and what is forgotten.},

Cofilin/ADF are inactivated by phosphorylation at the serine residue at position 3 by LIM-kinases (LIMKs) and testicular protein kinases (TESKs) and are reactivated by dephosphorylation by the slingshot (SSH) family of protein phosphatases and chronophin. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the signaling mechanisms regulating LIMKs and SSHs and the functional roles of cofilin phospho-regulation in cell migration, tumor invasion, mitosis, neuronal development, and synaptic plasticity. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the phospho-regulation of cofilin/ADF is a key convergence point of cell signaling networks that link extracellular stimuli to actin cytoskeletal dynamics and that spatiotemporal control of cofilin/ADF activity by LIMKs and SSHs plays a crucial role in a diverse array of cellular and physiological processes. Perturbations in the normal control of cofilin/ADF activity underlie many pathological conditions, including cancer metastasis and neurological and cardiovascular disorders. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Learning through trial-and-error interactions allows animals to adapt innate behavioural ĝ€rules of thumbĝ€™ to the local environment, improving their prospects for survival and reproduction. Naive Drosophila melanogaster males, for example, court both virgin and mated females, but learn through experience to selectively suppress futile courtship towards females that have already mated. Here we show that courtship learning reflects an enhanced response to the male pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), which is deposited on females during mating and thus distinguishes mated females from virgins. Dissociation experiments suggest a simple learning rule in which unsuccessful courtship enhances sensitivity to cVA. The learning experience can be mimicked by artificial activation of dopaminergic neurons, and we identify a specific class of dopaminergic neuron that is critical for courtship learning. These neurons provide input to the mushroom body (MB) 3 lobe, and the DopR1 dopamine receptor is required in MB3 neurons for both natural and artificial courtship learning. Our work thus reveals critical behavioural, cellular and molecular components of the learning rule by which Drosophila adjusts its innate mating strategy according to experience. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Shirangi2013,
abstract = {Many animals utilize acoustic signals-or songs-to attract mates. During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males vibrate a wing to produce trains of pulses and extended tone, called pulse and sine song, respectively. Courtship songs in the genus Drosophila are exceedingly diverse, and different song features appear to have evolved independently of each other. How the nervous system allows such diversity to evolve is not understood. Here, we identify a wing muscle in D.melanogaster (hg1) that is uniquely male-enlarged. The hg1 motoneuron and the sexually dimorphic development of the hg1 muscle are required specifically for the sine component of the male song. In contrast, the motoneuron innervating a sexually monomorphic wing muscle, ps1, is required specifically for a feature of pulse song. Thus, individual wing motor pathways can control separate aspects of courtship song and may provide a "modular" anatomical substrate for the evolution of diverse songs},

Genomic disorders, the syndromes with multiple manifestations, may occur sporadically du e to unequal recombination in chromosomal regions with specific architecture. Therefore, each patient may carry an individual structural variant of DNA sequence (SV) with small insertions and deletions (INDELs) sometimes less than 10 bp. The transposable elements of the Tc1/mariner superfamily are often associated with hotspots for homologous recombination involved in human genetic disorders, such as Williams Beuren Syndromes (WBS) with LIM-kinase 1-dependent cognitive defects. The Drosophila melanogaster mutant agn ts3 has unusual architecture of the agnostic locus harboring LIMK1: it is a hotspot of chromosome breaks, ectopic contacts, underreplication, and recombination. Here, we present the analysis of LIMK1-containing locus sequencing data in agn ts3 and three D. melanogaster wild-type strains-Canton-S, Berlin, and Oregon-R. We found multiple strain-specific SVs, namely, single base changes and small INDEls. The specific feature of agn ts3 is 28 bp A/T-rich insertion in intron 1 of LIMK1 and the insertion of mobile S-element from Tc1/mariner superfamily residing {\~{}}460 bp downstream LIMK1 3'UTR. Neither of SVs leads to amino acid substitutions in agn ts3 LIMK1. However, they apparently affect the nucleosome distribution, non-canonical DNA structure formation and transcriptional factors binding. Interestingly, the overall expression of miRNAs including the biomarkers for human neurological diseases, is drastically reduced in agn ts3 relative to the wild-type strains. Thus, LIMK1 DNA structure per se, as well as the pronounced changes in total miRNAs profile, probably lead to LIMK1 dysregulation and complex behavioral dysfunctions observed in agn ts3 making this mutant a simple plausible Drosophila model for WBS.},

Here we examine the variability of interpulse interval among replicated laboratory strains of D. melanogaster. There is no significant variation among populations of different geographical origin. This suggests that interpulse interval is subject to strong selection, as the populations are known to differ for other characters. One population, however, was sufficiently different to allow a genetic analysis. Reciprocal FjS and backcrosses implied that the variance was predominantly additive and autosomal. Possible sources of selection on interpulse interval are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.},
